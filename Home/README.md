### Description ###
This project takes all the pirate attacks over the course of a year and analyzes them based on location and description. Based on these attributes, we can decipher the results of many pirate attacks, which areas are most susceptible, and better understand what specifically drives pirates to steal certain materials.


### Requirements ### 
Make sure to install all the required libraries from the `requirements.text` file.
```
pip install -r ~/pirate-tracker/Home/requirements.txt
```
## Methodology

## Collecting our Data on Pirate Attacks
We had first acquired the **API** from an online provider (HONG FILL THIS OUT)

Click on the "Use this template" button in the top right corner to create a new
repository based on this template. If this is for a class project, we ask that
you keep it in the `olincollege` GitHub organization, and that you refrain from
keeping the repository private. This will ensure that relevant people can access
your repository for assessment, etc.

## Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file is blank and should be filled out with any project
dependencies. There is a Python package called `pipreqs` that autogenerates the
contents of the `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your
`.py` files. To get this, run

```
pip install pipreqs
```

Then, in the root of your project repository, run:

```
pipreqs --mode compat
```

If you already have a `requirements.txt`, the above command will ask you to
rerun the command with the `--force` flag to overwrite it.
