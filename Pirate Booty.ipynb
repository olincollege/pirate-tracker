    "\n",
    "This project takes all the pirate attacks over the course of a year and analyzes them based on location and description. Based on these attributes, we can decipher the results of many pirate attacks, which areas are most susceptible, and better understand what specifically drives pirates to steal certain materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using online resources (data found through APIs and PDFs), we can visualize the pirate attacks across the globe, what results typically spur from pirate attacks, and much of the nature of piracy. Using nearby port exports and imports, we can further understand what specifically pirates are stealing, and if they are related to many of the goods these ships are carrying.\n",

    "Through the usage of online resources, we were able to find both an API that will allow us to collect information on various port data (exports and imports), and also found a PDF from `insert link` that provided us with information on pirate attacks over the course of the 2024 year. Given this information, we were able to use an online library, `fitz`, to help digest this information. This online library helps process text block by block, in favor a line by line solution. This is important because it allows us to help analyze the **description** "
