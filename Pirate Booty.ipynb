    "### **Visualizing Pirate Attacks Across the Globe** ###\n",
    "Through the usage of online resources, we were able to find both an API that will allow us to collect information on various port data (exports and imports), and also found a PDF from online (https://www.recaap.org/) that provided us with information on pirate attacks over the course of the 2024 year. Given this information, we were able to use an online library, `fitz`, to help digest this information. This online library helps process text block by block, in favor a line by line solution. This is important because it allows us to help analyze the **description** of the function by testing different phrases against it (*a later problem*).\n",
    "\n",
    "By processing the data through a function that calls `fitz`, `regex`, and `pandas` - libraries of which digest text, analyze structure, and sort into dataframes respectively - we were provided with `pirate_locations.csv`. The columns of the CSV are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Index of Incident\n",
    "* Latitude\n",
    "* Longitude \n",
    "* Area Location\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this CSV file, of which contains **107 entries**, we can then store these dataframes in empty lists and run operations over said lists. For example, we had to prepare our latitude and longitude data through conversions of **DMS** format (direction, minute, seconds) to degrees, a value that is easier to process and plot. Through this conversion, and accessing an online library through a variety of online libraries - `Geopandas`, `Geodatasets`, `Shapely`, some of the previous libraries accessed (`regex`) - we were then able to visualize our specific pirate attack incidents over a world map. Given this same data, we had also specifically zoomed in on areas around Southeast Asia, a hotspot for real-world piracy for further context.\n",
